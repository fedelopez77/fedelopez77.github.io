Nonetheless, they exhibit a hierarchical structure. Hyperbolic spaces offer a mathematically appealing approach for learning hierarchical representations of symbolic data. However, it is not clear how to integrate hyperbolic components into downstream tasks. This is the first work that proposes a fully hyperbolic model for multi-class multi-label classification, which performs all operations in hyperbolic space. We evaluate the proposed model on two challenging datasets and compare to different baselines that operate under Euclidean assumptions. Our hyperbolic model infers the latent hierarchy from the class distribution, captures implicit hyponymic relations in the inventory, and shows performance on par with state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained classification with remarkable reduction of the parameter size. A thorough analysis sheds light on the impact of each component in the final prediction and showcases its ease of integration with Euclidean layers.","tags":null,"title":"A Fully Hyperbolic Neural Model for Hierarchical Multi-Class Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590501347,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590501347,"objectID":"06610f44fd1bd0c133661c94e7ce056a","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/talk/20200526-maths/","publishdate":"2020-05-26T14:55:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/20200526-maths/","section":"talk","summary":"Invited Speaker @ Hyperbolic geometry \u0026 Data Science Seminar, Heidelberg University, May 2020","tags":[],"title":"The Shortest History of Geometric Deep Learning","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582033653,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582033653,"objectID":"116c33e34c3ff9b0e3bb4ca5cbcae4fc","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/talk/20200218-unimannheim/","publishdate":"2020-02-18T14:47:33+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/20200218-unimannheim/","section":"talk","summary":"Invited Speaker @ University of Mannheim, February 2020","tags":[],"title":"A Fully Hyperbolic Neural Model for Hierarchical Multi-class Classification","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1581877802,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581877802,"objectID":"0c1b68c3cdef27b837005af992689328","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/project/summanlp/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T19:30:02+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/summanlp/","section":"project","summary":"Summa is a Python text summarizer developed as a Software Engeneering final project.","tags":[],"title":"Summa NLP","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1581791798,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581791798,"objectID":"6c7953fce228784bcbdd3cecb0bc158a","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/project/gensim-contrib/","publishdate":"2020-02-15T19:36:38+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/gensim-contrib/","section":"project","summary":"Integration of Summa to the Gensim natural language framework.","tags":[],"title":"Gensim","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[""],"content":"","date":1581705375,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581705375,"objectID":"b2080ca10152fafcc010a5e382547124","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/project/langdetect/","publishdate":"2020-02-14T19:36:15+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/langdetect/","section":"project","summary":"Language detection library in Python.","tags":[],"title":"langdetect","type":"project"},{"authors":["**Federico López**","Benjamin Heinzerling","Michael Strube"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559779200,"objectID":"59412ea0af86ce8dc944ff786d56d55c","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/publication/figet_2019_repl4nlp/","publishdate":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/figet_2019_repl4nlp/","section":"publication","summary":"How can we represent hierarchical information present in large type inventories for entity typing? We study the suitability of hyperbolic embeddings to capture hierarchical relations between mentions in context and their target types in a shared vector space. We evaluate on two datasets and propose two different techniques to extract hierarchical information from the type inventory: from an expert-generated ontology and by automatically mining the dataset. The hyperbolic model shows improvements in some but not all cases over its Euclidean counterpart. Our analysis suggests that the adequacy of this geometry depends on the granularity of the type inventory and the representation of its distribution.","tags":null,"title":"Fine-Grained Entity Typing in Hyperbolic Space","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557838331,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557838331,"objectID":"1194d3bd34bc70db8ebc8398e5b30404","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/talk/20190514-icl/","publishdate":"2019-05-14T13:52:11+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/20190514-icl/","section":"talk","summary":"Colloquium @ Heidelberg University, May 2019","tags":[],"title":"Fine-grained Entity Typing","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527599937,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527599937,"objectID":"31d88993429835575bfc20497797ce17","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/talk/20180529-icl/","publishdate":"2018-05-29T14:18:57+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/20180529-icl/","section":"talk","summary":"Colloquium @ Heidelberg University, May 2018","tags":[],"title":"An Overview on Entity Discovery and Linking Systems","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Federico Barrios","**Federico López**","Luis Argerich","Rosa Wachenchauzer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438732800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438732800,"objectID":"a957575a0734f6c1ef6bd4c6337d207c","permalink":"https://fedelopez77.github.io/publication/textrank_2016_asai/","publishdate":"2015-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/textrank_2016_asai/","section":"publication","summary":"This article presents new alternatives to the similarity function for the TextRank algorithm for automated summarization of texts.
